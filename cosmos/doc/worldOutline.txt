* initialize
  - reads vertices from entities
  - reads perspective from camera
* pollInput
  - modifies velocities
  - treats camera and entities the same
* move
  - reads velocities
  - modifies positions
  - treats camera and entities the same
* draw
  - reads positions
  - treats camera and entities differently

Camera
  - has perspective (read-only)
  - has velocity
  - has position

Entity
  - has vertices (read-only)
  - has velocity
  - has position
